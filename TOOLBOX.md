# TOOLBOX
Last updated: 05-06-2022

A list of the tools I use. And also noteworthy ones that I've tried or am keen to try. 

## Devices and Operating Systems

### PHYSICAL MACHINE
I'm using an old SONY VAIO S Series VPCS125FG laptop with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-350M 2.27GHz CPU, 8.00GB RAM and 160GB SSD Storage. It's running on Windows 10 Home (64-bit).

### VIRTUAL MACHINE
I'm running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS through Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL). Frankly speaking, I have no idea how I managed to get it working nor am I aware if I'm running WSL 1 or WSL 2. Nor am I familiar with the functional differences between the two.


## Software Packages

## Starship - Cross-shell Prompt
Link: https://starship.rs
I'm using starship to customise my prompt mostly because I'm a sucker for portable solutions. Currently, using it to prettify my bash terminal whilst I entertain the occasional fantasies of switching to zsh (for no good reason actually). Having said that, I'm still on the default starship configuration and haven't really mucked around to customising my prompt. Cause you know... it doesn't really matter.

### Neovim - hyperextensible VIm-based text editor
Link: https:neovim.io
In all honesty, I installed neovim without a just because apart from wanting to feel fancy. The use case that I am romanticizing frequently is to use neovim to drive a plain text personal knowledge management system. Currently, I'm swimming around looking to figure out how to manage plug-ins and wondering which ones to bother installing.

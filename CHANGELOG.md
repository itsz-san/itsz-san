# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project **may or may not** adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). I haven't gotten around to reading the whole specification nor do I feel compelled to. Until I am confident about Semantic Versioning, no promises here. _Not that it matters to anyone else_.

## [0.0.1] - 2022-05-03
